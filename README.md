# Simiel Blog

A Modern React Blog — Rediscovered

---

## ✨ Project Backstory

Built during my university years, this project was my playground for learning modern web development. While my classes focused on outdated tech, I dove into React, component-based architecture, and modern tooling—pushing myself beyond the curriculum.

## 🚀 Features

- Modular, component-based UI (Header, Topbar, Sidebar, Posts, Home)
- Responsive design with scoped CSS for each component
- Organized asset management for images
- Easy local development and build scripts
- Foundation for a full-featured blog platform

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **Create React App**: Zero-config setup for development/build
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: Testing utilities
- **CSS**: Component-scoped styling
- **Browserslist**: Ensures cross-browser compatibility
